# # ADAN 8888.01 Project
## Structural Exposures and Returns: Forecasting Total Shareholder Return of Public Real Estate Companies by Operating Region and Articulating Value

## Repository Structure

- Data/ — Raw and processed datasets
- Docs/ — Assignment requirements, setup notes, and meeting minutes.
- Models/ — Training scripts and saved model artifacts.
- Notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and analysis.
- Reports/ — Interim and final reports in **PDF only**.
  
## How to run
1. Clone the repo or open it in GitHub Codespaces.
2. Open the notebooks in `Notebooks/`.
3. Put raw data in `Data/raw/` and processed outputs in `Data/processed/`. Update any paths if needed.

## Notes
- All reports must be PDFs stored in `Reports/`.
- Do not commit files larger than 100 MB. If datasets are large, upload them to cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) and include the link/instructions in `Docs/`.
- Keep secrets (API keys, tokens) out of the repo; use a `.env` and add it to `.gitignore`.
